# Do-you-really-know-about-this-function-
Deeply look into the function that we use. 

Many beginners(including me), we just use the functions because we have to use them.
We don't know the exact algorithm how the function work. 

For this reason, I'll introduce the function and how it works.

I'll explain functions with example! It's gonna be fun:)
